# Rustful Youtube Downloader
This is a very low-key python-made youtube downloader. It was made with tkinter, so mind the old looking graphics, but it will work. This was made to eliminate all of the sketchy online ones, with the weird ads, notification requests, and popups. This has nothing besides python, and a simple UI with no ads. Source is also provided, so feel free to look through it!

## How to Install
All you need to do is download the Executable, and run it. I recommend leaving it somewhere, like your desktop, because the video will be downloaded wherever you have the executable.

### Linux and MacOS Users:
The Script is there, and works fine. I would really enjoy it if any of you have Python installed, and make an executable for your device, as (for now) my bootable flash drive to Ubuntu has broken, therefore I'm stuck on Windows 7, so I can not compile it myself. Please open an issue if you do it, and I will give you full credit.
